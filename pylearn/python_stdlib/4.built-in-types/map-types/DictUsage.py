# These represent finite sets of objects indexed by nearly arbitrary values.
# The only types of values not acceptable as keys are values containing lists or dictionaries or other mutable types
# that are compared by value rather than by object identity, the reason being that
# the efficient implementation of dictionaries requires a keyâ€™s hash value to remain constant
